czifilename,expected_return_code,known_good_output

# The column 'czifilename" specifies a CZI to be checked. The following rules apply:
# * if option '--czisourcepath' is given to CZICheckRunTests.py, then this path is prepended to the filename
# * if option '--redirect' is given, then the filename is replaced by what is specified with this option. The argument
#    given with '--redirect' is of the form '<filename>=<redirected_filename>', where redirected_filenamne may be
#    an absolute path (in which case the '--czisourcepath' is not preprended).
#
# The column 'expected'return_code' specifies the return code of the executable that is expected.
#
# The column 'know_good_output' gives the filename of the program's expected output (to stdout). This filename is searched
#  for in the path given with the option '--knowngoodresultspath'. The special value '*' is instructing to NOT check
#  the program's output, so this comparison is skipped.
